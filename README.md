My attempt at writing a voxel engine in C++ with OpenGL


# Information
this is a voxel engine writtin in [C++](https://cplusplus.com) with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org) with the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org) library meaning it **SHOULD BE** fully cross platform

## Compilation

While this project may be compiled **FOR** systems like Windows or Linux it does not mean it can be compiled **ON** those systems. This is because I have developed this project souly on MacOS and so you may have to edit the makefile for your specific needs on your specific system. If you are going to try to compile it you should know

1). glad is using core profile

2). the shader version is 330 core (also information for glad)

I know this isn't the most cross platform or professional way of doing things but this is simply a hobby project I made for myself as a learning experience so keep that in mind.
